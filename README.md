Dipperin is an open source blockchain project, designed for business. Dipperin allows you build your blockchain network and create a programmable financial ecosystem.

## Features
1. VRF based consensus mechanism   
A fundamental challenge of all PoS-based protocols is to keep enough randomized/fair result during the leader election process.
VRF(Verifiable Random Function) is a new algorithm introduced to add more randomness in many new generation blockchain. More details please refer to  [dipperin vrf yellow page](https://dipperin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design/yellowpaper.html#dpow-consensus)
2. WASM dApp runtime virtual machine   
Wasm(Web Assembly) is a standard for web browsers developed by W3C workgroup that includes Google, Mozilla, and others. The multitude of languages that compile to Wasm(Web Assembly), are an ideal alternative to EVM. It was developed so that code can be deployed in any browser with the same result. Wasm is high performance—it’s built to be as close to native machine code as possible while still being platform independent. It facilitates small binaries to ship over the internet to devices with potentially slow internet connection. There’s been many years of work put into Wasm, both by compiler and standardisation teams.
3. Multi-chain system  
The road to a programmable economy will take long term to reach its full potential. Dipperin encourages multiple chains co-existing and communicating with each other. What this means is that blockchains sharing similar networks will be able to transfer value between each other. While in use in a business ecosystem, businesses will no longer have to contend only with clients on a network the business as built on. Instead, companies will be able to transact with clients from other compatible blockchains. The entire process will take place without any downtime or expensive transaction fees. Just as is the case with the Internet of value, cross blockchain compatibility will accord blockchain networks an effective means of value transmission.
