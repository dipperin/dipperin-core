Dipperin is an open source blockchain project, designed for business. Dipperin allows you build your blockchain network and create a programmable financial ecosystem.

## Features
1. VRF based consensus mechanism   
VRF(Verifiable Random Function) is a new algorithm introduced to add more randomness in many new generation blockchain. Our consensus mechanism through VRF guarantee the randomness and fairness of the consensus population generation, and ensure that state finality can be reached quickly. More details please refer to  [dipperin vrf yellow page](https://dipperin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design/yellowpaper.html#dpow-consensus)
2. WASM DApp runtime virtual machine   
Web Assembly (Wasm) is a standard for web browsers developed by W3C workgroup that includes Google, Mozilla, and others. Wasm is high performance. Wasm, and the multitude of languages that compile to Wasm, are an ideal alternative to EVM.
3. Multi-chain system  
The road to a programmable economy will take long term to reach its full potential. Dipperin encourages multiple chains co-existing and communicating with each other. What this means is that blockchains sharing similar networks will be able to transfer value between each other. While in use in a business ecosystem, businesses will no longer have to contend only with clients on a network the business as built on. Instead, companies will be able to transact with clients from other compatible blockchains. The entire process will take place without any downtime or expensive transaction fees. Just as is the case with the Internet of value, cross blockchain compatibility will accord blockchain networks an effective means of value transmission.
