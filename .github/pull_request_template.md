**Short change description**   
A short one-line summary of the change, prefixed by the primary affected package.   
A rule of thumb is that it should be written so to complete the sentence "This change modifies Dipperin-core to _____." That means it does not start with a capital letter, is not a complete sentence, and actually summarizes the result of the change.    

**A description of the changes proposed in the pull request**   
Ex.The random argument should be spread to args. Current code only randomly generates the first argument and the second one is always 0.

**A reference to a related issue**   
The special notation "Fixes #12345" associates the change with issue 12345 in the Go issue tracker. When this change is eventually applied, the issue tracker will automatically mark the issue as fixed.   
If the change is a partial step towards the resolution of the issue, uses the notation "Updates #12345".

**@mentions of the person or team responsible for reviewing proposed changes**   
Ex.@Dipperin-core/developer or @Dipperin-core/XXX
